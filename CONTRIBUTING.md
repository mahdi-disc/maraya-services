# Contributing to Maraya Services

Welcome! 👋  
We're excited that you're interested in contributing to **Maraya Services**, part of the Maraya Dynamic Risk Profiling (DRP) platform. This project aims to provide modular, intelligent, and scalable threat-detection services — and we believe it can only get better with your help.

## 🧠 How to Contribute

We follow a **micro-task** approach to streamline contributions and maintain code quality.

### ✅ 1. Find or Request a Micro-Task
All new features and improvements are broken down into small, actionable **micro-tasks**, tracked via the [Issues](../../issues) tab.

- Check the list of open issues.
- Pick one that not assigned or resolved.
- If your idea isn't listed, open a new issue and describe your proposal.

### 🔨 2. Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahdi-disc/maraya-services.git
cd maraya-services
```

### 🌱 3. Create a Branch

Use the following command to create a new feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-task-name
````

### 💎 4. Code with Quality

We value:

* Clean, modular, and readable Python code.
* Tests for any new logic (see `tests/` directory).
* Descriptive commit messages.
* Following PEP8 and our existing code style.

---

### 🧪 5. Run Tests

Before submitting your code, run all tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

### 📬 Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your forked repository.
2. Open a **pull request to the `dev` branch** — **not `main`**.
3. Include a clear description of what you’ve done.
4. Link the relevant issue in the PR description.

> 🔍 All pull requests will be reviewed before being merged.

### 💬 Communication

If you're unsure about anything, feel free to:

* Comment on an issue.
* Start a discussion in the Discussions tab (if enabled).
* Tag a maintainer in your pull request.

We’re here to help and collaborate.
